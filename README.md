This C program is designed to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Réaumur scales based on user input. Here's a concise explanation of the program:

The program starts by prompting the user to choose the temperature scale they want to convert from (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, or Réaumur).

Based on the user's choice, the program calls the corresponding function to perform the temperature conversion.

Each conversion function prompts the user to enter the temperature in the chosen scale and the desired scale for conversion.

The program then calculates and displays the converted temperature in the desired scale.

If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays an "Invalid choice" message.

The program consists of four conversion functions: celcius() for Celsius conversions, fohrenheit() for Fahrenheit conversions, kelvin() for Kelvin conversions, and reumer() for Réaumur conversions.

Each conversion function takes user input, performs the necessary calculations, and displays the converted temperature in the desired scale.

Overall, this program provides a simple and interactive way for users to convert temperatures between different scales.
